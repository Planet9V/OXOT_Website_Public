# The Braincube third-party risk finding alone could be your “unique insight” that wins the deal!

That Braincube point is exactly the kind of **“I see something your current partners are ignoring”** angle that can win you the deal if you frame it correctly.

## Why Braincube is your unique insight

- ofi is publicly celebrating Braincube as a core **manufacturing transformation platform**, with 6.5% yield gain and 25% throughput improvement at a key cocoa plant, driven by AI‑recommended setpoints applied directly on the line.[^1][^2][^3][^4]
- Braincube connects shop‑floor data, industrial protocols, and cloud analytics for food and beverage manufacturers, including direct integration with PLCs and OT networks.[^3][^5][^6][^1]
- Food manufacturing is rapidly converging IT and OT, with 90%+ of plants allowing remote access and SaaS/IIoT connections, which greatly expands the attack surface.[^7][^8][^9]
- Industry data shows **third‑party access is now one of the biggest root causes of incidents**: recent studies report ~30–42% of breaches in manufacturing are tied to vendors and third‑party access paths.[^10][^11][^12]

Put simply: **Braincube is an enormous value lever for ofi, and simultaneously a high‑risk OT backdoor if unsecured.** That combination is your wedge.

## How to say it to ofi

Use this as a sharp, differentiated line in your pitch:

> “Your Braincube deployment is a genuine competitive advantage—6.5% yield and 25% throughput is huge—but it also creates a single, high‑value third‑party path straight into your PLCs and OT network. Hardening that one connection, to IEC 62443 standards, may be the single highest‑ROI cyber action you can take.”[^2][^9][^11][^1][^10][^3]

Then add the “unique insight” hook:

> “Most security partners talk about firewalls and ransomware in general. Almost no one is coming to you saying: *‘Your Braincube OT bridge is now one of the top third‑party risks in your entire estate, and here’s exactly how to secure it without losing your 6.5% yield and 25% throughput gains.’* That’s the gap we’re here to close.”[^8][^11][^12][^1][^2][^3]

## Concrete Braincube risk framing

You can break it into three bullets:

- **Direct OT access:** Braincube ingests live process data and can drive AI‑recommended setpoints back into control logic, which implies connectivity between Braincube infrastructure and plant PLCs/SCADA.[^13][^6][^1][^2][^3]
- **SaaS / third‑party exposure:** Braincube runs as an IIoT / SaaS platform with cloud services, APIs, and remote access—exactly the pattern threat intelligence and breach reports highlight as growing third‑party risk in manufacturing.[^11][^5][^12][^7][^10]
- **Industry trend:** OT ransomware and third‑party breaches in food and manufacturing have surged (OT ransomware up ~87% YoY, third‑party breaches ~30%+ of incidents), and vendor remote access is called out as a key weak point.[^14][^12][^8][^10][^11]

This allows you to say:

> “If an attacker ever compromises Braincube or its integration path at one of your cocoa plants, they don’t just see data—they potentially inherit the same knobs Braincube uses to boost yield and throughput. That is a unique, high‑impact third‑party risk we can quantify and fix.”[^8][^1][^10][^2][^3][^11]

## Offer a very specific mitigation

Position a focused workstream, not a generic assessment:

- **“Braincube OT Integration Security Review”**
    - Map Braincube data flows to PLCs/SCADA and SAP.[^6][^1][^2]
    - Validate zones \& conduits design and segmentation around Braincube (Purdue L3/3.5/4).[^15][^16][^17][^14]
    - Lock down authentication, API security, and remote access for Braincube admins.[^7][^11][^14][^8]
    - Align Braincube integration with IEC 62443‑3‑3 and 4‑2 requirements for SL‑T at the cocoa/dairy OT zones.[^18][^19][^20][^15]

You can frame it as:

> “Let’s pick **one flagship Braincube‑enabled cocoa line** and do a 4–6 week security deep dive on that integration. We’ll come back with a quantified risk number, specific hardening steps, and updated IEC 62443‑aligned design. If you don’t get at least one ‘board‑level’ insight out of that, you don’t expand with us.”[^20][^1][^10][^2][^3][^15]

That makes Braincube not just an interesting detail, but **the anchor insight** that shows you understand ofi’s digital transformation better than generic OT security vendors.
