provide an overiview of OFI, its business unites and organiaaiotnal sturucre; and provide a reference, which organizes all teh soruces, examiens their information for overlappin, and what information is available

This comprehensive intelligence dossier on Olam Food Ingredients (OFI) has been prepared by OXOT to support professional engagement and strategic planning. OFI represents a highly complex, vertically integrated global leader in the food and beverage ingredients sector, currently navigating a pivotal transition toward a public listing and digital maturity.
I. OFI Corporate Overview
OFI was established in 2020 following the strategic reorganization of Olam International Limited to dismantle the "conglomerate discount" and unlock shareholder value. Unlike its sister entity, Olam Agri—which focuses on high-volume bulk commodities—OFI is engineered as a value-added "plant-to-palate" solutions provider.
• Financial Standing: In 2024, OFI reported a revenue of S$21.8 billion, representing 40.1% year-over-year growth. The organization is considered the "crown jewel" of the Olam Group, achieving a 29.1% EBIT growth in the same period.
• Operational Footprint: OFI operates over 120 manufacturing facilities and 19 innovation centers across 51 countries.
• Strategic Mandate: The company is currently executing an aggressive "Hyper everything" digital transformation strategy and preparing for a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
II. Business Units (Platforms)
OFI organizes its operations into five distinct product platforms, each characterized by high-care industrial processes and specific technological requirements:
1. Cocoa: Anchored by the heritage deZaan brand, this platform maintains major hubs in the Netherlands (Koog aan de Zaan), Germany (Mannheim), and West Africa (Abidjan). It is a capital-intensive unit focused on alkalization, roasting, and pressing.
2. Coffee: This unit combines a massive green bean trading network with high-tech soluble (instant) coffee manufacturing in Spain (Seda Outspan), Brazil (Linhares), and Vietnam (Long An).
3. Dairy: Focused on high-value functional ingredients, this platform recently expanded with a major processing facility in Tokoroa, New Zealand. It manages safety-critical processes like pasteurization and spray drying.
4. Nuts: Operating through brands like Hughson Nut, this platform dominates the global almond and cashew trade with significant manufacturing clusters in California and Vietnam.
5. Spices: Following the acquisition of Olde Thompson, OFI operates the world’s largest garlic and onion dehydration plant in Hanford, California, and maintains a "spice corridor" across the Southwestern U.S. and Vietnam.
III. Organizational and Leadership Structure
OFI utilizes a distributed "Center of Excellence" model, particularly in the Netherlands, where functions are split between innovation in Amsterdam, manufacturing in Koog aan de Zaan, and commercial trading in Rotterdam.
• Executive Leadership:
    ◦ A. Shekhar (CEO): Architect of the spin-off and primary lead for the impending IPO.
    ◦ Rishi Kalra (CFO): Manages financial architecture and ROI-driven capital allocation.
    ◦ Felix Mathew (Deputy CISO): Directly oversees the global cybersecurity posture.
    ◦ Stephen Byers (CDIO): Strategic lead for digital transformation and the relationship with Mindsprint.
• Support Entities:
    ◦ Mindsprint: Formerly the internal IT division of Olam, now a standalone digital services partner providing cybersecurity (GuardianEye), cloud, and AI services to OFI.

Discuss what these sources say about Cocoa, in the larger context of Core Platforms.

This intelligence report, prepared by OXOT, analyzes the Cocoa Platform of Olam Food Ingredients (OFI). Within the broader framework of OFI’s reorganization from Olam Group, the Cocoa platform serves as a cornerstone of the "plant-to-palate" business model, characterized by high capital intensity, heritage brand leadership, and aggressive digital maturation.
I. Strategic Positioning within Core Platforms
OFI identifies five core platforms: Cocoa, Coffee, Dairy, Nuts, and Spices. While other platforms like Spices have seen aggressive inorganic growth (e.g., Olde Thompson), Cocoa remains a primary profit engine.
• Global Leadership: OFI is recognized as the world's #1 global cocoa originator and a top-three global cocoa processor.
• Vertical Integration: The platform manages the entire value chain, from procurement in 10 key producing countries to processing facilities situated near major consumption markets in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.
• Customer Integration: The Cocoa platform serves approximately 2,000 of OFI's 11,000 global customers, including major B2B brands such as Nestlé, Hershey’s, and Kellogg’s.
II. Global Industrial Infrastructure
OFI’s cocoa operations are bifurcated between Origin Processing (stabilizing raw materials near growth zones) and Destination Processing (tailoring products near consumer markets).
• The European Processing Core: The "Zaan Cluster" in the Netherlands is the flagship of the platform. This includes the heritage deZaan facilities in Koog aan de Zaan and Wormer, which produce premium cocoa mass, butter, and powder.
• Central European Hub: The Mannheim facility (Olam Cocoa Deutschland GmbH) leverages its location on the Rhine and Neckar rivers to supply the massive German confectionery market.
• North American Anchor: The Bolingbrook, Illinois plant is OFI’s sole cocoa processing facility in the U.S., grinding cocoa cake into powder for the Midwest manufacturing base.
• Origin Processing Nodes: Major hubs include Abidjan (Unicao) and San Pedro in Côte d'Ivoire, and Kumasi in Ghana.
• Asian Expansion: Following the acquisition of BT Cocoa, OFI operates a major processing facility in Tangerang, Indonesia, targeting the region's trajectory to become a leading global consumer of cocoa powder.
III. Digital Transformation and Operational Technology
As part of OFI's "Hyper everything" strategy, the Cocoa platform is the primary beneficiary of advanced Industrial AI and Operational Technology (OT) enhancements.
• Braincube AI Deployment: OFI deployed the Braincube IIoT platform at a major cocoa facility to solve biological variability in cocoa beans. This digital twin ("Product Clone") technology resulted in a 6.5% yield increase, a 25% throughput improvement, and eight months of 100% quality scores.
• Autonomous Factory Vision: The platform is transitioning from "Open Loop" advisor modes to "Closed Loop" control, where AI writes optimized setpoints directly to Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) on the production line.
• Predictive Maintenance: Through a partnership with ABB, OFI has deployed smart sensors on low-voltage motors in cocoa plants (including Singapore) to monitor vibration and temperature, predicting failures before downtime occurs.
IV. Sustainability and Regulatory Compliance
The Cocoa platform faces significant scrutiny due to its complex supply chain, leading to the development of the Cocoa Compass sustainability initiative.
• Choices for Change: Under OFI's overarching 2030 strategy, the Cocoa platform aims for 100% traceability and effective remediation of all identified human rights and child labor cases.
• EUDR Readiness: OFI is prioritizing chain-of-custody data to meet the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) 2025 deadline. This involves plot-level mapping of more than one million farm plots using the OFIS (Olam Farmer Information System) mobile tool.
• Circular Economy: OFI utilizes "circular biomass boilers" in the Netherlands, Germany, Brazil, and Singapore that burn residual cocoa shells to generate steam, reducing natural gas usage and carbon emissions by up to 50%.
V. Innovation and Brand Architecture
The platform leverages a tiered brand strategy to target different market segments:
• deZaan: A global heritage brand (>110 years) focused on premium ingredients and application excellence.
• Twenty Degrees: A specialized business unit sourcing premium, single-origin cacao from remote regions (e.g., Papua New Guinea, Ecuador) for the craft chocolate market.
• Huysman: Provides efficient, reliable cocoa powders for the North American and Asian markets.
• Cocoa Academy: Based in Amsterdam, this technical unit provides hands-on workshops for manufacturing professionals to develop new product concepts.

Discuss what these sources say about Integrated Risk Assurance Framework (IRAF), in the larger context of Frameworks.

This dossier, prepared by OXOT, provides a comprehensive analysis of the Integrated Risk Assurance Framework (IRAF) utilized by Olam Group and its operating groups, ofi and Olam Agri. The IRAF serves as the group’s primary mechanism for ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls across its global operations.
I. Overview and Core Purpose of IRAF
The IRAF is designed to provide a "single view of assurance" for a wide spectrum of quantifiable and non-quantifiable risks. It acts as a centralized reporting platform that integrates the level, impact, frequency, and ownership of risk to assist the Board and its committees in their oversight roles.
The framework monitors 49 distinct risks organized into 11 categories, including trading, agricultural, currency, operational, political, and regulatory risks. Within this structure, IRAF evaluates the effectiveness of control measures against the likelihood of occurrence and potential business impact.
II. Operational Architecture and Workflow
The IRAF is anchored by the Internal Audit (IA) function and is built upon the "Four Lines of Defence" principle.
• The Four Lines of Defence:
    1. First Line: Business units on the ground.
    2. Second Line: Group functions such as Finance, IT, Risk, and Legal.
    3. Third Line: Internal Audit.
    4. Fourth Line: External Audit.
• The Quarterly Validation Process:
    1. A validation request is sent to all business units and functional teams every quarter.
    2. IA monitors the online completion and follows up on outstanding items.
    3. Validation results regarding the performance and effectiveness of control activities are shared with functional teams.
    4. IA reviews and discusses these results with functional heads.
    5. Consolidated final assessments are presented to the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC).
III. Strategic Evolution: IRAF 2.0
In 2024, the group implemented IRAF 2.0 with technical support from KPMG. This update involved a thorough review of the first and second lines of defense and refined the risk identification process at the entity and country levels. This evolution was intended to provide a more robust basis for management to confirm the adequacy of internal controls to shareholders as required by listing rules.
IV. Sub-Group Customization
While the Olam Group maintains an overarching framework, the IRAF has been adapted for its specific operating entities to address their unique challenges.
• ofi and Olam Agri: Both have their own tailored IRAF platforms that reflect their specific business models—ofi as a value-added ingredient provider and Olam Agri as a high-volume logistics merchant.
• Integration: The results from these individual sub-group platforms are subsequently incorporated back into the consolidated Group IRAF for a holistic view.
V. IRAF in the Broader Framework Ecosystem
Within Olam’s governance structure, the IRAF is the internal foundational framework that intersects with several other specialized global and technical frameworks:
• Cybersecurity and OT Frameworks: The IRAF identifies cybersecurity and IT risks as one of its 11 core categories. In this context, it works alongside technical standards such as IEC 62443 for industrial security design and MITRE ATT&CK for ICS for construction of realistic attack scenarios.
• Sustainability and Climate Frameworks: IRAF supports the "Responsible Sourcing" focus area by evaluating traceability and supplier engagement. It operates in conjunction with the GRI and SASB standards for reporting, as well as the TCFD and TNFD frameworks for climate and nature-related financial disclosures.
• Regulatory Frameworks: The IRAF is a critical tool for meeting the "Duty of Care" requirements of the EU NIS2 Directive, particularly regarding supply chain security auditing and incident reporting.

Discuss what these sources say about Olam Palm Gabon, in the larger context of Continuing Assets.

This analysis, prepared by OXOT, evaluates Olam Palm Gabon (OPG) within the strategic framework of the Remaining Olam Group. Under the 2020 reorganization, Olam Group Limited bifurcated into ofi, Olam Agri, and the Remaining Olam Group. Olam Palm Gabon is a core component of the Continuing/Gestating Businesses segment under the Olam Global Holdco umbrella.
I. Strategic Positioning within "Continuing Assets"
In the corporate architecture of the Remaining Olam Group, OPG is categorized as a "gestating" asset. This classification dictates a specific management philosophy:
• Monetization Mandate: The primary objective of the Remaining Olam Group is to nurture these businesses to their full potential for partial or full monetization over time.
• Divestment Strategy: As Olam Group moves toward a "debt-free and self-sustaining" holding model, these assets are held as long-term value levers that will eventually be responsibly divested to de-leverage the group's balance sheet.
• Governance: OPG operates as a 60:40 joint venture between Olam Global Holdco and the Republic of Gabon.
II. Industrial and Operational Footprint
OPG represents one of the most significant industrial investments in the Central African region, focused on vertical integration from plantation to refinery.
• Land Management: The entity controls a concession area of 144,000 hectares, of which over 50% (72,000 ha) is permanently protected forest, wetlands, and savannah.
• Manufacturing Infrastructure: OPG operates three palm oil mills producing crude palm oil (CPO) and one edible oil refinery that produces cooking oil and soap for the domestic Gabonese market.
• 2024 Operational Performance: Despite a 9% yield decline caused by extreme dry weather and water deficits, OPG improved its oil extraction rates by 3% for crude palm and 1% for palm kernel oil. Its oil refinery saw an 8% growth in volume during the same period.
III. Sustainability and Environmental Resilience
OPG serves as Olam Group's "lighthouse" for sustainable agriculture, achieving benchmarks that are critical for future monetization.
• Certification Leadership: OPG is the largest RSPO-certified (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) producer in Africa.
• Climate-Positive Status: The plantations are the only ones globally independently assessed as climate positive, sequestering more atmospheric carbon than the operations emit.
• Circular Bioenergy: OPG generates its own power by capturing methane from mill effluents through biogas technology, significantly reducing its reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, fruit bunch fibers are repurposed in boilers to generate steam for sterilization and energy.

Discuss what these sources say about Rusmolco, in the larger context of Continuing Assets.

This intelligence dossier, prepared by OXOT, analyzes the role of Rusmolco within the strategic framework of Olam Group Limited’s "Continuing Assets." As Olam Group continues its fundamental restructuring, Rusmolco represents a significant industrial anchor within the Remaining Olam Group (ROG), a segment dedicated to nurturing high-potential businesses toward full maturity or monetization.
I. Strategic Context: The Remaining Olam Group (ROG)
Following the 2020 reorganization, Olam Group was divided into three operating entities: ofi, Olam Agri, and Remaining Olam Group. While ofi focuses on value-added ingredients and Olam Agri handles high-volume commodities, the ROG functions as a specialized vessel for three distinct categories of assets:
• Incubating Businesses: Digital-first startups like Nupo Ventures (Terrascope).
• Shared Services: Global capability centers like Mindsprint.
• Olam Global Holdco (OGH): This division manages De-prioritised/Exiting Assets (earmarked for divestment) and Continuing/Gestating Businesses.
Rusmolco is classified within the Continuing/Gestating Businesses segment alongside Olam Palm Gabon, Packaged Foods (Caraway), and ARISE Ports & Logistics. The mandate for these continuing assets is to drive operational excellence and sustainable growth until the Group decides to partially or fully monetize them.
II. Rusmolco: Operational Profile and Market Position
Rusmolco (Russian Dairy Company) is a 100% subsidiary of Olam Group and stands as a leader in Russia’s large-scale dairy and crop production sector.
• Geographic Footprint: The operations are centered in the Penza region of Russia.
• Market Function: Despite the current geopolitical complexities in the region, Rusmolco continues to operate as a critical supplier for the domestic Russian milk market, providing raw materials to international processors that remain active in the territory.
• Vertical Integration: The business combines sophisticated herd management with large-scale cropping to produce its own animal feed, ensuring a closed-loop production cycle.
III. 2024 Operational Performance
In 2024, Rusmolco demonstrated significant growth, contributing to the improved earnings reported for the "Continuing/Gestating" segment.
• Herd Growth: The total herd increased by 10%, reaching 35,966 animals.
• Production Volume: Total milk output surged by 34%, rising from 161.2 million liters in 2023 to 216.4 million liters in 2024.

Discuss what these sources say about ARISE P&L, in the larger context of Continuing Assets.

This intelligence report, prepared by OXOT, analyzes the role and current status of ARISE Ports & Logistics (ARISE P&L) within the strategic framework of Olam Group Limited’s restructuring. As Olam Group continues to bifurcate its primary operations into ofi and Olam Agri, ARISE P&L has been positioned as a major component of the Remaining Olam Group, specifically under the stewardship of Olam Global Holdco (OGH).
I. Organizational Structure and Scope
ARISE P&L is a specialized infrastructure and logistics entity operating primarily as a joint venture between the Olam Group, the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), and other strategic partners, including the Gabonese Republic, Meridiam, and STOA. Its operational footprint is concentrated in West and Central Africa:
• Gabon: Manages a mineral port, a general cargo port, a special economic zone (GSEZ), and an airport.
• Mauritania: Operates a strategic container port.
• Côte d’Ivoire: Manages a bulk port facility in San Pedro.
II. Classification within Continuing/Gestating Assets
Within the "Remaining Olam Group" structure, ARISE P&L is classified as a Continuing/Gestating Business. This category is designed for assets that require ongoing development or are being managed with a view toward eventual monetization or divestment.
ARISE P&L sits alongside other high-impact, asset-heavy continuing businesses, including:
• Rusmolco: A large-scale dairy farming operation in Russia.
• Olam Palm Gabon: A major sustainable palm oil joint venture.
• Packaged Foods: Olam’s consumer-facing business in West Africa (e.g., the Caraway brand).
• Mindsprint: The digital technology services spin-off.
III. Operational and Financial Performance (2024)
The 2024 fiscal year was a period of significant headwind for the Continuing/Gestating Businesses segment, which reported a combined EBIT loss of S$96.1 million.
• Economic Impact: The financial results of the segment were notably "dragged down" by ARISE P&L’s performance. Sources indicate that the business suffered from reduced economic activities in its key operating geographies, which hampered the profitability of its port and logistics infrastructure.
• Contrast with Peer Assets: While peer assets like Rusmolco reported record milk production (up 34% year-over-year) and improved earnings, the losses at ARISE P&L and weather-impacted yields at Olam Palm Gabon drove the segment into a net loss.
IV. Strategic Divestment and Reorganization
The broader mandate for the Remaining Olam Group is to become debt-free and self-sustaining by responsibly divesting non-core assets. ARISE P&L has been a primary target for this capital redeployment strategy.
• Stake Divestment: In April 2025, Olam Group announced a definitive agreement to sell its remaining 32.4% stake in ARISE P&L for US$175 million.
• Exit from Infrastructure: This sale marks Olam’s complete withdrawal from the heavy infrastructure sector, following previous exits from ARISE IIP (Industrial Platforms) and ARISE IS (Infrastructure Services).
• Rationale: The divestment of these "Continuing Assets" is essential for de-levering the balance sheet of the Remaining Olam Group. By liquidating heavy infrastructure holdings, the group can clear debt overhangs and focus capital on its primary value drivers: the ofi IPO and the high-volume caloric flows managed by Olam Agri.
V. Implications for Global Logistics
Despite the divestment, the assets managed by ARISE P&L remain critical nodes in the global supply chain, particularly for cocoa and timber. For instance, the bulk port in San Pedro, Côte d'Ivoire, is the primary export point for the country’s western cocoa belt, directly supporting ofi’s origin processing facilities. The transition of ARISE P&L from an Olam-owned subsidiary to an independently managed, third-party logistics provider necessitates that Olam implement rigorous Supply Chain Security and traceability audits—such as those required by the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and NIS2 Directive—to ensure the digital and physical hygiene of its former logistics partners.

This collaboration serves as the flagship initiative within ofi’s broader "Hyper everything" digital transformation strategy, specifically targeting the intersection of agricultural biological variability and advanced industrial automation.
I. Strategic Context: The "Hyper Everything" Vision
ofi is currently executing an aggressive digital mandate characterized by four key pillars: automation, optimization, digitalization, and convergence. As the organization prepares for its IPO on the London Stock Exchange, its innovation strategy has shifted from a "conglomerate" model to a value-added "plant-to-palate" approach.
The Braincube partnership is a critical component of "Supply Chain 4.0," which utilizes connected networks and big data to drive constant optimization across ofi’s 120+ manufacturing facilities. Within this framework, ofi is moving beyond basic data collection toward Prescriptive Automation and the creation of the "Autonomous Factory".
II. Core Technology: The "Product Clone" Digital Twin
The technological backbone of the partnership is Braincube's "Product Clone" technology. This innovation addresses the "time-lag problem" inherent in continuous manufacturing processes, such as cocoa roasting and grinding.
• Algorithmic Synchronization: In a standard processing line, sensors generate data at different stages (cleaning, roasting, winnowing) at different times. The Product Clone calculates dynamic lag times across conveyors and silos to stitch these disparate data points into a single, batch-specific dataset.
• Managing Biological Variability: Agricultural inputs like cocoa beans are inherently variable based on origin and harvest conditions. The Braincube platform allows ofi to move away from fixed "average recipes" toward dynamic adjustments based on the chemical and physical state of the material inside the machine.
• CrossRank AI: This proprietary algorithm ranks thousands of variables to identify the "Golden Batch"—the precise combination of roaster temperatures, fan speeds, and moisture levels that historically produced the highest yield and quality.
III. Empirical Operational Outcomes
The deployment of Braincube at one of ofi’s flagship cocoa processing facilities (likely in the Netherlands or Germany) has redefined operational limits for the sector. The results significantly exceeded the initial project targets:
1. Yield Improvement: ofi achieved a 6.5% increase in yield, far surpassing the initial target of 2-3%. This represents a massive recovery of raw material value in a high-volume, low-margin industry.
2. Throughput Increase: The facility realized a 25% improvement in throughput. By using AI to reduce process variance, operators could run "bottleneck" machines closer to their design capacity without risking jams or quality defects.
3. Quality Consistency: The line achieved 100% quality scores for eight consecutive months post-implementation.
4. Sustainability Gains: The efficiency improvements contribute to the Cocoa Compass goals by reducing energy intensity per tonne of product and maximizing the efficiency of carbon-intensive land used for cocoa cultivation.
IV. Integration within the Digital Ecosystem

• The Digital Thread: Mindsprint manages the integration between Braincube’s operational data and ofi’s enterprise-level SAP S/4HANA (RISE on AWS). This allows real-time yield data to update costing models and inventory planning automatically.
• Control Evolution: ofi is transitioning from an "Open Loop" (Advisor Mode), where AI displays recommendations for human operators, to a "Closed Loop" (Autopilot) model, where the Braincube system writes optimized setpoints directly to the PLC memory registers.
V. Digital Innovation Risks: The "Trust Trap"
While the partnership provides a competitive advantage, it introduces a unique third-party risk profile that ofi must manage under the EU NIS2 Directive.
• Third-Party OT Backdoor: Because Braincube requires direct connectivity to plant PLCs and SCADA networks to push setpoint optimizations, it creates a high-value entry path for attackers.
• Attack Scenarios: OXOT identifies the "Braincube Trust Trap" as a critical risk, where a compromise of the vendor’s API keys could allow a nation-state actor to inject malicious setpoints—such as lowering pasteurization temperatures—leading to contamination, mass recalls, and brand destruction.
• Mitigation Strategy: ofi is addressing these gaps by hiring dedicated OT Security Engineers in hubs like Bangalore and Vietnam to conduct ICS risk assessments and implement network segmentation between the cloud-based AI and safety-critical control logic.
