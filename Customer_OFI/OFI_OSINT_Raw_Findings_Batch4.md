# OSINT Batch 4 Findings

## 10. Physical Security
- **Findings**: No specific security vendors (HID, Lenel) or fencing details found for Tokoroa or Shanghai CSC.
- **Inference**: Security is standard for the industry but not publicly documented.
- **Assessment**: Physical entry would likely rely on social engineering (e.g., "Visitor" badges) rather than bypassing high-tech perimeter controls, as no specific vulnerabilities were found.
