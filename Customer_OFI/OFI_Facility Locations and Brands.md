# **Global Industrial Asset Atlas & Operational Resilience Report: Olam Food Ingredients (ofi) and Olam Agri**

## **Executive Summary**

The reorganization of Olam Group has precipitated a fundamental restructuring of the global agricultural landscape, bifurcating operations into two distinct, purpose-built entities: **Olam Food Ingredients (ofi)** and **Olam Agri**. This strategic divergence has created two specialized industrial footprints, each with unique asset classes, geographic concentrations, and operational imperatives. **ofi** has emerged as a titan of value-added ingredients, controlling a sophisticated network of processing facilities that transform raw agricultural commodities—Cocoa, Coffee, Dairy, Nuts, and Spices—into specialized food solutions. In contrast, **Olam Agri** commands the heavy logistics and primary processing infrastructure required for high-volume staples like Grains, Animal Feed, Edible Oils, Cotton, and Wood.

This report provides an exhaustive, granular audit of this bifurcated global asset base. It moves beyond high-level regional summaries to identify, locate, and analyze specific manufacturing sites, processing plants, and logistical hubs. From the historic cocoa grinding halls of **Koog aan de Zaan** in the Netherlands to the high-tech soluble coffee towers of **Linhares, Brazil**, and from the sprawling cotton gins of **Queensland, Australia** to the garlic dehydration complexes of **Hanford, California**, this document maps the physical reality of Olam’s dominance.

Furthermore, this analysis integrates a critical dimension of modern industrial risk: cybersecurity. As these operational technology (OT) environments become increasingly digitized—leveraging the capabilities of Olam’s technology arm, **Mindsprint**—they face escalating threats from ransomware and state-sponsored actors. By juxtaposing physical asset locations with the digital threat landscape defined by frameworks such as **MITRE EMB3D** and regulations like the **EU NIS2 Directive**, this report offers a holistic view of operational resilience in a volatile global market.

**Part I: Olam Food Ingredients (ofi) – The "Plant to Palate" Industrial Network**

**ofi** operates a vertically integrated supply chain that is distinct in its "plant-to-palate" philosophy. The company’s industrial footprint is strategically divided into **Origin Processing** (facilities located in growing regions to stabilize raw materials and reduce shipping weight) and **Destination Processing** (facilities located near consumer markets to tailor products to specific client formulations). This dual-node structure ensures both cost efficiency and high-touch customer service.

### **1\. The Cocoa Platform: Heritage, Chemistry, and Logistics**

The cocoa business is the cornerstone of ofi’s ingredient portfolio, anchored by the heritage brand **deZaan**. The industrial infrastructure for cocoa is massive, capital-intensive, and requires precise chemical engineering capabilities (alkalization, roasting, pressing).

#### **1.1 The European Processing Core: The Zaan Cluster**

Europe remains the global hub for premium cocoa processing, and ofi’s assets here are historic and critical. The Netherlands, specifically the region along the Zaan river, has been the heart of the global cocoa trade since the 17th century. ofi controls two primary assets in this cluster.

The Koog aan de Zaan Facility (deZaan)  
Located at Stationsstraat 76, 1541 LJ Koog aan de Zaan, Netherlands 1, this facility is the flagship of the deZaan brand. It is not merely a production site but a center of technical excellence. Here, raw cocoa beans are transformed into cocoa mass (liquor), butter, and powder. The "deZaan" powders produced here are renowned for their specific colors and flavor profiles, achieved through proprietary alkalization (Dutching) processes refined over a century.3 The location on the Zaan river is logistically vital, allowing for the direct barge transport of cocoa beans from the Port of Amsterdam, reducing overland logistics costs and carbon footprint.  
The Wormer Facility  
Just across the river system lies the second critical Dutch plant at Veerdijk 18, 1531 MS Wormer, Netherlands.4 The proximity of the Wormer and Koog aan de Zaan plants allows for significant operational synergies. Management, maintenance crews, and technical expertise can be shared across the "Zaan Cluster." Together, these plants form a processing node that services the high-demand markets of Western Europe, supplying butter to chocolatiers and powder to dairy and bakery giants.  
Innovation Hub: Amsterdam Customer Solutions Center (CSC)  
To bridge the gap between manufacturing and consumer application, ofi operates a CSC at Joan Muyskenweg 30, 1114 AN Amsterdam, Netherlands.5 This facility houses culinary kitchens and sensory labs where food scientists work with the outputs from Koog and Wormer to co-create new confectionery products with clients.

#### **1.2 The German Processing Node**

Serving the massive Central European industrial market (Germany, Switzerland, Austria) is the **Mannheim** facility.

* **Address:** **Neckarvorlandstraße 36-42, 68159 Mannheim, Germany**.6  
* **Entity:** **Olam Cocoa Deutschland GmbH**.  
* **Strategic Context:** Located at the confluence of the Rhine and Neckar rivers, Mannheim is a key inland port. This facility receives raw materials via river barge from Rotterdam, bypassing road congestion. It specializes in producing cocoa liquor and butter for the German confectionery industry, which is the largest in Europe. The site’s integration into the German industrial river system is a key competitive advantage in terms of logistics costs.8

#### **1.3 Origin Processing: West Africa**

To retain value in origin countries and reduce the shipment of waste (shells/moisture), ofi has invested heavily in processing capacity in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana.

**Côte d'Ivoire (The Global Cocoa Engine)**

* **Abidjan (Unicao):** Located in the **Zone Industrielle de Vridi**, specifically at **Rue des Textiles, 15 BP 406 Abidjan 15**.9 This plant, often operating under the **Unicao** brand, processes raw beans into semi-finished products. The Vridi industrial zone is adjacent to the Port of Abidjan, ensuring that processed butter and cake can be immediately containerized and shipped.  
* **San Pedro:** A second facility is located at **Zone Industrielle du Domaine Portuaire de San Pedro, BP 1663**.4 San Pedro is the primary export point for cocoa grown in the western belt of the country. Having a facility here mitigates the risk of logistical bottlenecks at Abidjan and reduces the distance raw beans must travel from farm to factory.

**Ghana (The Quality Benchmark)**

* **Kumasi:** The processing plant is located in the **Kaase Industrial Area**, at **Plot 7-9 Kaase Industrial Area, PO Box KS1966, Kumasi**.4 Kumasi is the capital of the Ashanti region, the heartland of Ghanaian cocoa. Processing here allows ofi to secure high-quality Ghanaian beans (known for their higher fat content and specific flavor) directly at the source.

#### **1.4 The Americas & Asia: Regional Hubs**

* **United States (Bolingbrook):** The sole cocoa processing facility in the U.S. is at **990 Veterans Parkway, Bolingbrook, IL 60440**.11 This plant grinds cocoa cake into powder, serving the massive food manufacturing base in the American Midwest (Chicago is a traditional confectionery hub).  
* **Brazil (Ilhéus):** Located at **Rodovia Ilheus-Urucuca, Km 4, Distrito Industrial Ilheus, BA 45658-335**.4 Ilhéus is the historical center of Brazil's "Cocoa Coast." This plant processes beans for the large domestic Brazilian market and for export to other South American nations.  
* **Singapore (ASEAN HQ):** The processing plant is at **342 Jalan Boon Lay, Singapore 619527**.12 It produces cocoa butter and powder for the Asian market, leveraging Singapore’s free trade agreements and logistics efficiency.  
* **Indonesia (BT Cocoa):** Following the acquisition of BT Cocoa, ofi operates a major plant at **Jl. Dipati Unus no. 30, Cibodas, Tangerang, Banten 15138**.4 This facility is critical for supplying cocoa powder to the Asian market, where reddish/dark powders are in high demand for biscuits and beverages.

## ---

**Part III: Operational Resilience, Cybersecurity, and Regulation**

The physical assets listed above do not exist in a vacuum. They are increasingly connected via **Industrial Control Systems (ICS)** and **Operational Technology (OT)** to the internet, creating a new vector of risk.

### **1\. The Digital Threat Landscape**

The food and agriculture sector is now a primary target for cyberattacks. In Q1 2025 alone, ransomware attacks on this sector **doubled** compared to the previous year.66

* **Ransomware Risks:** Groups like **RansomHub** and **BlackCat** are actively targeting agricultural infrastructure. An attack on a facility like the **Hanford garlic plant** or the **Tokoroa dairy plant** could halt production, causing spoilage of perishable raw materials and disrupting global supply chains.  
* **Threat Actors:** State-aligned groups such as **APT32 (OceanLotus)**, which has a history of targeting Vietnam-based multinational entities 67, pose a specific espionage threat to ofi's extensive operations in **Long An** and **Bien Hoa**, Vietnam. The theft of intellectual property (e.g., spice blends or processing techniques) is a credible risk.

### **2\. Regulatory Compliance: NIS2 Directive**

The **EU NIS2 Directive**, effective October 2024, explicitly classifies the food sector as "essential" or "important".69

* **Affected Locations:** ofi’s plants in **The Netherlands (Koog/Wormer)**, **Germany (Mannheim)**, and **Spain (Palencia)** are directly in scope.  
* **Requirements:** These facilities must now implement:  
  * **24-Hour Incident Reporting:** Any significant cyber incident must be reported to national authorities (e.g., Dutch CSIRT) within 24 hours.  
  * **Supply Chain Security:** Olam must vet the cybersecurity posture of its suppliers (e.g., logistics providers for the Mannheim plant).  
  * **Personal Liability:** Senior management can be held personally liable for non-compliance, elevating cybersecurity from an IT issue to a board-level imperative.

### **3\. Mitigation Framework: MITRE EMB3D**

To secure the embedded devices running these plants (PLCs, sensors, HMIs), Olam is likely adopting the **MITRE EMB3D** threat model.71

* **Application:** This framework helps OT engineers at plants like **Club Coffee in Toronto** or **Unicao in Abidjan** understand specific threats to their equipment (e.g., a "Forceful Re-flash" attack on a roaster's controller) and implement mitigations.  
* **Mindsprint:** Olam’s technology arm, **Mindsprint**, plays a crucial role here. Their **GuardianEye** platform 72 likely provides the real-time monitoring required to detect threats across this sprawling global asset base, connecting a cotton gin in rural Australia with a cyber-defense center in Singapore.

### **4\. Supply Chain Transparency: EUDR**

The **EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)** impacts ofi's assets in **Côte d'Ivoire (Cocoa)**, **Brazil (Coffee/Cocoa)**, and **Indonesia (Cocoa)**.

* **Requirement:** Products processed at EU plants (e.g., Mannheim) must be traceable back to a specific plot of land that was not deforested after 2020\.  
* **Asset Implication:** The origin processing plants (e.g., San Pedro, Ilhéus) are now not just physical processors but data gateways. They must digitally verify the geolocation of every bag of beans before processing, integrating this data into the **AtSource** sustainability platform.73

## ---

**Conclusion**

The asset map of Olam Food Ingredients and Olam Agri reveals a sophisticated, bifurcated strategy. **ofi** has built a high-value network centered on processing excellence in Europe and North America, supported by origin extraction in the tropics. **Olam Agri** has entrenched itself as a logistics and food security titan in emerging markets like Nigeria and strategic origins like Australia.

However, this physical network is now overlaid with a complex digital and regulatory grid. The specific addresses listed in this report—from **9301 E. Lacey Blvd in Hanford** to **Stationstraat 76 in Koog aan de Zaan**—are no longer just production sites; they are nodes in a cyber-physical network that must be defended against ransomware, compliant with strict EU directives, and transparent enough to prove their sustainability to the world.
