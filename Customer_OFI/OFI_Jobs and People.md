# **Human Capital Configuration and Operational Intelligence Report: ofi (Olam Food Ingredients) Netherlands**

## **1\. Strategic Preamble: The Corporate Metamorphosis**

The contemporary organizational landscape of **ofi** (Olam Food Ingredients) within the Netherlands cannot be understood in isolation; it is the physical manifestation of a profound strategic recalibration initiated by the parent entity, Olam Group. To comprehend the specific roster of professionals, job functions, and operational hubs identified in this research, one must first dissect the corporate genesis that necessitated their existence.

### **1.1 The De-conglomeration Mandate**

In January 2020, Olam Group announced a seminal reorganization plan aimed at unlocking long-term value by dismantling the "conglomerate discount" that had historically plagued its stock valuation.1 The strategy involved a deliberate bifurcation of the business into three distinct operating groups: **ofi** (Olam Food Ingredients), Olam Agri, and the Remaining Olam Group.1

This schism was not merely administrative but philosophical. While Olam Agri retained the high-volume, logistics-heavy commodity businesses (grains, feed, fiber), **ofi** was engineered to be a value-added ingredients provider. Its portfolio—Cocoa, Coffee, Dairy, Nuts, and Spices—was selected for its potential to move up the value chain, transitioning from simple "farm-gate" collection to complex "plant-to-palate" solutions.3

### **1.2 The Netherlands as the Strategic Anchor**

In this new world order, the Netherlands emerged not just as a regional office, but as a critical operational anchor for **ofi**'s global ambitions. The research indicates that the Dutch footprint is disproportionately significant compared to other European markets, serving as a convergence point for three distinct strategic pillars:

1. **Global Cocoa Dominance:** Leveraging the historical infrastructure of the Zaan district (the "Silicon Valley of Cocoa") to anchor the company's highest-value processing assets.4  
2. **Commercial & Digital Innovation:** Utilizing Amsterdam's tech-friendly ecosystem to launch **ofi Services**, a captive digital consultancy, and a flagship Customer Solutions Center (CSC).6  
3. **Strategic Communications & Governance:** Positioning Rotterdam as a hub for global brand architecture and commercial trading.8

The personnel identified in this report—ranging from site directors managing heavy industry to AI consultants optimizing process mining—reflect this multi-dimensional mandate. **ofi** in the Netherlands is effectively a microcosm of the future company the board envisions: sustainable, tech-enabled, and deeply integrated into the consumer food value chain.

## ---

**2\. The Dutch Geostrategy: A Tripartite Operational Matrix**

The human capital analysis reveals a highly specific geographic distribution of talent. Unlike centralized corporations that house all functions in a single headquarters, **ofi** employs a distributed "Center of Excellence" model within the Netherlands. This dispersion dictates the type of talent recruited in each city and informs the organizational culture of each sub-unit.

### **2.1 Geographic Functional Mapping**

| Operational Hub | Primary Function | Talent Archetype | Key Strategic Asset |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Amsterdam** | Innovation & Digital Services | Food Scientists, AI Engineers, Solution Architects | Customer Solutions Center (CSC), **ofi** Services |
| **Koog aan de Zaan / Wormer** | Manufacturing & Sustainability | Process Engineers, Plant Managers, Lobbyists | deZaan Cocoa Factory, Biomass Energy Systems |
| **Rotterdam** | Commercial & Communications | Traders, Procurement Directors, Brand Managers | Global Marketing Team, Logistics/Port Access |

### **2.2 Operational Interdependency**

While geographically distinct, these hubs are functionally intertwined. The raw cocoa beans arriving via the Port of Rotterdam (managed by the Commercial team) are processed in Koog aan de Zaan (managed by the Industrial team) into premium powders. These powders are then transported to the Amsterdam CSC, where food scientists (the Innovation team) co-create new confectionery products with global clients. Finally, the success stories of these sustainable, low-carbon products are packaged by the Communications team (back in Rotterdam) for global dissemination.

This "Plant to Palate" workflow 4 is the golden thread connecting the disparate job profiles identified in the public domain. It explains why a **Maintenance Engineer** in Wormer 9 is professionally linked to a **Category Lead** in Amsterdam 5—they are upstream and downstream nodes of the same value creation process.

## ---

**3\. Innovation & Digital Transformation: The Amsterdam Hub**

The Amsterdam operation represents the "new face" of the company. Deviating from the traditional image of a commodity trader, the Amsterdam offices—hosting both the Customer Solutions Center and **ofi Services**—are staffed by a cohort of professionals focused on technology, sensory science, and customer experience.

### **3.1 The Customer Solutions Center (CSC): The Engine of Co-Creation**

#### **3.1.1 Strategic Function**

The Amsterdam CSC is one of several global hubs (alongside Chicago, Singapore, and Bangalore) designed to facilitate "co-creation".7 This facility is not a sales office; it is a laboratory. The personnel here are tasked with solving technical challenges for customers—for example, preventing texture degradation in plant-based yogurts or achieving the perfect color in a dark chocolate cookie using specific deZaan powders.5

#### **3.1.2 Key Personnel and Roles**

* **Pilar Darre**  
  * **Role:** Head of Amsterdam Customer Solutions Center (CSC).5  
  * **Operational Intelligence:** As the leader of this facility, Darre occupies a critical nexus between R\&D and Commercial Sales. Her quoted statement, "The ofi Customer Solutions Center in Amsterdam is conveniently located for our customers to spend the day with us reviewing insights," 7 underscores her role as a host of high-level B2B engagement. She likely manages a multidisciplinary team of chefs and food scientists, ensuring that the facility's output directly supports the sales pipeline. Her background likely combines technical food knowledge with business management, enabling her to translate "flavor" into "revenue."  
* **Senior Scientist \- Plant-Based Ingredients (Vacancy)**  
  * **Role Context:** The identification of this vacancy 9 is a potent signal of strategic direction. It confirms that the Amsterdam CSC is actively expanding its capabilities in the alternative protein sector.  
  * **Responsibilities:** This individual would be responsible for characterizing the functional properties of nut and spice ingredients in dairy-free applications. The role implies a high level of academic and practical expertise, likely requiring a PhD or MSc in Food Science. The focus on "Plant-Based" directly aligns with **ofi**'s strategic pivot toward high-growth consumer categories.3  
* **Assistant Food & Beverage Manager**  
  * **Role Context:** This position 9 supports the operational fluidity of the CSC. Given the facility includes "Culinary and demonstration kitchens" 7, this manager likely oversees the logistics of client visits—ensuring ingredients are stocked, equipment is functional, and the sensory tasting sessions run smoothly.

### **3.2 The Rise of "ofi Services": An Entity Analysis**

Perhaps the most revealing finding of this research is the existence of **"ofi Services,"** a distinct entity based in Amsterdam that operates as a "next-generation service company".6

#### **3.2.1 Entity Profile**

**ofi Services** appears to be an internal capability center designed to insulate the broader group from the inefficiencies typical of large agribusinesses.

* **Headcount & Demographics:** The unit is relatively lean, with approximately 25 employees identified in the dataset.6 The demographic profile—average age of 35 and a 50/50 gender split—suggests a culture that is distinct from the male-dominated, older demographics often found in commodity trading floors or industrial plants.  
* **Mission:** The unit's stated goal is to "accelerate innovation, optimize operations, and prepare for the future of work".6 This is corporate shorthand for Digital Transformation.

#### **3.2.2 The Technological Mandate: Celonis and AI**

The job listings associated with **ofi Services** provide a blueprint of the company's technological roadmap. They are not hiring generalist IT support; they are hiring specialists in advanced data fields.

* **Focus Area 1: Process Mining (Celonis)**  
  * **Evidence:** The recruitment of a "Consultant with a focus on Celonis (Process Mining)" 10 is significant. Celonis is an enterprise software used to visualize execution gaps in business processes (e.g., Supply Chain Management, Accounts Payable).  
  * **Implication:** By investing in this capability, **ofi** is acknowledging the complexity of its global supply chain and seeking to use data to root out inefficiencies. This consultant would be responsible for "x-raying" the company's workflows to find where time or money is leaking—a critical function for margin protection in an inflationary environment.  
* **Focus Area 2: Artificial Intelligence & Hyperautomation**  
  * **Evidence:** Multiple listings for "AI & Innovation Interns" 10 and a "Senior Consultant – AI Focus".10  
  * **Skill Set:** These roles require "Basic programming skills in Python" and knowledge of "OpenAI, LangChain".11  
  * **Implication:** **ofi** is actively building internal GenAI capabilities. This is likely deployed for market intelligence (scraping data on crop yields), automated reporting, or even customer service bots. The "Hyperautomation" terminology 12 suggests a strategy to automate complex, decision-based tasks, not just repetitive manual entry.

#### **3.2.3 Talent Strategy**

The decision to base this unit in Amsterdam is strategic. The city is a European hub for data science and creative tech. By branding this unit as "**ofi Services**" rather than just the "IT Department," the company positions itself to compete for talent against tech firms like Booking.com or Adyen, which also compete for the same Amsterdam-based talent pool.

**4\. Industrial Sovereignty: The Cocoa Heartland (Koog aan de Zaan)**

While Amsterdam represents the future, Koog aan de Zaan represents the industrial foundation. This region, specifically the Zaanstreek, has been the global capital of cocoa processing for over a century. **ofi**'s presence here is anchored by the heritage brand **deZaan**.4

### **4.1 Operational Leadership**

The management of a heavy processing facility requires a leadership profile defined by operational rigor, safety consciousness, and capital project management.

* **Joost van der Hoogte**  
  * **Role:** Site Director, Koog aan de Zaan.4  
  * **Operational Intelligence:** As Site Director, Van der Hoogte bears ultimate responsibility for the factory's output. His remit includes "walking along" with visitors to showcase production 4, indicating he is also the public face of the facility. His daily reality involves managing labor relations with the shift operators, ensuring the uptime of roasting and pressing machinery, and, crucially, managing the site's environmental footprint.  
  * **Strategic Weight:** The Koog site produces premium ingredients (deZaan). Any disruption here impacts high-margin contracts globally. Van der Hoogte's role is therefore one of high pressure and high visibility within the Global Manufacturing division.

### **4.2 The "Cocoa Academy" Faculty**

Embedded within or near the industrial site is the **Cocoa Academy**, a specialized education unit. The personnel here bridge the gap between the factory's technical capabilities and the commercial team's needs.

* **Wouter Stomph**  
  * **Role:** Category Lead Bakery | Cocoa.5  
  * **Profile:** Stomph represents the technical application side of sales. His expertise lies in the interaction between cocoa powder and baking chemistry. He acts as a "translator," explaining to industrial bakers why a specific deZaan powder will improve their biscuit's crunch or color.  
* **Lesya Melechyn**  
  * **Role:** Category Lead \- Chocolate & Confectionery | Cocoa.5  
  * **Profile:** Managing the chocolate category—the most direct application of the product—Melechyn likely deals with the company's most demanding clients. Her role involves running workshops on "Coatings & Fillings" 13, effectively training customers on how to use **ofi** products.  
* **Naveen Pessani**  
  * **Role:** Category Manager \- Chocolate & Confectionery | Cocoa.13  
  * **Profile:** Working in tandem with Melechyn, Pessani likely focuses on the portfolio management aspect—ensuring the right mix of products is available for the confectionery market segments.

### **4.3 Sustainability as an Industrial Function**

In the Netherlands, sustainability is not just a corporate policy; it is an industrial engineering challenge.

* **Susanne Folkerts**  
  * **Role:** Global Operations Head of Sustainability & Environment.14  
  * **Project Focus:** Folkerts is intimately linked to the **Biomass Boiler Project** in Koog aan de Zaan.14 This project utilizes waste cocoa shells to power the factory, aiming for a 50% reduction in natural gas usage. Her role involves overseeing the technical implementation of circular economy principles. She serves as the bridge between the company's Net-Zero commitments and the hard engineering reality of the plant.  
* **Eric Nederhand**  
  * **Role:** Lobbyist / Public Affairs (EU Transparency Register).16  
  * **Operational Intelligence:** Nederhand's presence in the register, with an office address in Koog aan de Zaan, is revealing. He is not a generic corporate lobbyist; he is embedded at the manufacturing site. His work focuses on the "Green Deal," "Energy Transition," and "Deforestation".16  
  * **Strategic Implication:** This suggests that **ofi**'s lobbying strategy is defensive and technical—protecting the factory's license to operate amidst strict Dutch nitrogen and emissions laws, and ensuring the supply chain meets EUDR (Deforestation Regulation) standards.

### **4.4 The Blue-Collar Backbone**

The research identifies a layer of essential operational roles that keep the factories running 24/7.

* **Process Operators (Junior & 5-Shift)**  
  * **Listings:** "Operator 5 ploegen" (5-shift system) 17 and "Junior Process Operator".9  
  * **Context:** The "5-shift" designation confirms continuous, round-the-clock production. These roles are the lifeblood of the Koog and Wormer sites, responsible for monitoring the roasters and presses.  
* **Maintenance Engineer (Wormer)**  
  * **Listing:** 9  
  * **Context:** Located in Wormer (a neighboring town with **ofi** facilities), this role is critical for Asset Reliability. The engineer ensures that the aging infrastructure of these heritage sites remains efficient and safe.  
* **R\&D Process Technology Manager**  
  * **Listing:** 18  
  * **Context:** Based in Koog, this role is distinct from the product developers in Amsterdam. This manager focuses on *process* innovation—how to tweak the machinery to produce a better powder or consume less energy.

## ---

**5\. Commercial Command & Brand Architecture (Rotterdam)**

Rotterdam, home to Europe's largest port, serves as the logistical and commercial valve for **ofi**'s European operations. However, the research reveals it also hosts a surprising function: Global Brand Communications.

### **5.1 The Commercial Engine**

The flow of commodities requires a sophisticated team of traders and procurement specialists.

* **Head of Procurement \- Ingredients (Vacancy)**  
  * **Role Context:** Identified in Rotterdam 9, this role suggests a centralization of European purchasing. This individual would oversee the strategic sourcing of non-cocoa ingredients or auxiliary materials required for the "solutions" business (e.g., stabilizers, sugars for pre-mixes).  
* **Senior Trader Animal Ingredients (Vacancy)**  
  * **Role Context:** Also based in Rotterdam 9, this role points to the valorization of by-products. The "Animal Ingredients" likely refer to the sale of cocoa shells or other processing residues into the animal feed market—a critical revenue stream that also supports waste reduction goals.  
* **Jurjen Ronner (Contextual Note)**  
  * *Correction:* While snippets associate him with Cefetra 19, which operates in similar circles, he is not currently identified as **ofi** staff. However, his presence in the same professional attendee lists highlights the tight-knit community of commodity traders in Rotterdam.

### **5.2 Global Branding from the Maas**

A key insight is that **ofi** has decoupled its Investor Relations (London) from its Brand Marketing (Rotterdam).

* **Global Communications Project Manager (Vacancy)**  
  * **Role Description:** The listing explicitly states, "marketing communications team is based in Rotterdam".8 This role acts as the "driving force behind all B2B branding projects."  
  * **Strategic Implication:** The Netherlands is the creative workshop for the **ofi** brand. This team is responsible for crafting the narrative that transforms a sack of nuts into a "sustainable, healthy snacking solution." They manage the trade shows (Fi Europe), the digital campaigns, and the brand assets used by sales teams globally.  
* **Senior Marketing Communications Manager**  
  * **Role Focus:** "Nuts & New Channels".20  
  * **Operational Intelligence:** This manager is tasked with raising the profile of the Nuts business (Cashews, Almonds, Walnuts) in Europe. The role involves "Customer campaign development" and "Social media strategy," indicating a push to make **ofi** a thought leader in the healthy snacking space.

**7\. Labor Market Analysis: Vacancy Signal Processing**

An analysis of the open positions (vacancies) provides predictive intelligence on where **ofi** is heading in the next 12-24 months. The job descriptions are not just requests for labor; they are statements of intent.

### **7.1 The Shift to Plant-Based**

The search for a **Senior Scientist \- Plant Based Ingredients** 9 is a pivotal data point.

* **Implication:** **ofi** is not content with just supplying nuts or cocoa. They aim to be the architect of the final product—the almond milk or the cashew cheese. By hiring scientists in this field, they are moving into direct competition with specialized ingredient firms like DSM-Firmenich or IFF. This suggests the Amsterdam CSC will see increased investment in equipment and personnel dedicated to dairy alternatives.

### **7.2 The Digital Talent War**

The cluster of vacancies for **ofi Services**—specifically for **Celonis Consultants** and **AI Interns**—reveals a digital maturity that is rare in the agribusiness sector.

* **Implication:** **ofi** recognizes that in a low-margin trading business, data is the new gold. "Process Mining" (Celonis) allows them to see exactly where a contract is delayed or where working capital is trapped in the supply chain. The recruitment of interns for "Innovation" suggests a "grow-your-own" talent strategy, likely because hiring senior AI engineers in Amsterdam's competitive market is expensive and difficult. They are building a pipeline of tech-savvy talent trained specifically on **ofi**'s proprietary data sets.

### **7.3 Marketing Centralization**

The vacancies in Rotterdam for **Global Communications** roles 8 indicate that the Netherlands is taking ownership of the brand narrative.

* **Implication:** As **ofi** prepares for its potential IPO and separate listing, the "brand story" becomes financial critical. The Rotterdam team is likely tasked with creating a consistent, premium identity that separates **ofi** from generalist commodity traders. We can expect more hiring in digital marketing, content creation, and B2B event management in Rotterdam.

## ---

**8\. Strategic Synthesis**

The Netherlands serves as the central nervous system for **ofi**'s European ambitions and a critical organ in its global body. The human capital configuration identified in this report reveals a sophisticated division of labor that leverages the unique strengths of three Dutch cities.

**Amsterdam** is the **Brain**, housing the intellectual property, the digital architects of **ofi Services**, and the creative food scientists of the **CSC**. It is where value is created through innovation.

**Koog aan de Zaan** is the **Heart**, pumping out the volume of product that sustains the business. It is the fortress of industrial capability, defended by site directors and lobbyists who navigate the complex regulatory environment to keep the machines running.

**Rotterdam** is the **Voice and Hand**, managing the physical flow of goods through the port and the broadcast of the brand message to the world.

For stakeholders, competitors, or prospective employees, **ofi** Netherlands presents itself not as a single entity, but as a diverse ecosystem. It offers the grit of industrial engineering, the adrenaline of the trading floor, and the intellectual challenge of AI development, all within a 100-kilometer radius. This geographic and functional density makes the Netherlands arguably the most critical operational node in **ofi**'s global network outside of Singapore.
