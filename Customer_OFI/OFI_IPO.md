# Strategic Initiatives (2024-2025)

✅ IPO Preparation - London Stock Exchange premium listing
✅ Digital Transformation - “Hyper everything” (edge, AI, automation)
✅ Financial Growth - 29.1% YoY EBIT growth, 573% profit jump H1 2025
✅ New Facilities - Chicago CSC, Shanghai CSC, NZ dairy plant (2023)
✅ Regulatory Compliance - EUDR 2025 deadline, FSSC 22000 food safety

I notice you've highlighted the Strategic Initiatives section. Would you like me to:

1. **Expand/Deep Dive** on any of these initiatives with more detail and cybersecurity implications?
2. **Update with Latest News** - Search for more recent announcements (Q4 2025) that I may have missed?
3. **Create a Strategic Alignment Map** - Visual showing how each initiative creates specific cybersecurity needs/opportunities?
4. **Develop Executive Talking Points** - Tailored messaging for each initiative to use in your pitch to Felix Mathew?
5. **Timeline Analysis** - Create a Gantt chart showing initiative timelines and optimal engagement windows?
6. **Risk Assessment** - Detailed cyber risks associated with each initiative (e.g., IPO due diligence requirements, AI integration vulnerabilities)?

Let me know which direction would be most valuable for your GTM strategy, and I'll provide additional analysis or assets!

Alternatively, if you'd like me to search for **more recent updates** (late 2025) on these initiatives or find additional strategic projects I may have missed, I can do that as well.
