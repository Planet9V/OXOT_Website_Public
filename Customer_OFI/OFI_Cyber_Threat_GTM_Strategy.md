# **Strategic Intelligence Dossier: Olam Food Ingredients (ofi)**

## **Comprehensive Account Analysis & Go-To-Market Strategy for Industrial Cyber Resilience**

### **1\. Executive Strategic Intelligence**

The global agricultural and food processing sector stands at a precarious intersection of digital transformation, geopolitical volatility, and escalating regulatory rigor. Within this landscape, **Olam Food Ingredients (ofi)** has emerged not merely as a supplier of raw commodities, but as a vertically integrated provider of value-added ingredients and solutions. For a specialized cybersecurity services organization—particularly one focused on **cyber threat monitoring, NIS2 compliance, and industrial facility commissioning**—ofi represents a high-value, complex target environment. The organization is currently navigating a significant corporate pivot, characterized by a structural separation from Olam Group, a delayed but impending Initial Public Offering (IPO), and a newly announced **US$500 million equity investment** aimed at accelerating growth.1

This report serves as a foundational intelligence dossier to inform a targeted Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy. It synthesizes financial data, operational footprints, technological dependencies, and threat landscapes to identify specific commercial entry points. The analysis reveals that ofi is aggressively modernizing its industrial base—evidenced by new dairy processing plants in New Zealand and biomass energy facilities in Europe—while simultaneously facing the "compliance cliff" of the **EU NIS2 Directive** in its key German and Dutch jurisdictions. These dual pressures create an urgent, unmet need for specialized **Operational Technology (OT) security** and **Secure-by-Design commissioning** services that generalist IT providers, such as ofi's captive partner **Mindsprint**, may be ill-equipped to deliver in isolation.

The narrative that follows deconstructs ofi’s business to expose these vulnerabilities and opportunities. It moves beyond high-level observations to analyze specific industrial processes—from cryogenic spice milling in Vietnam to milk powder spray drying in Tokoroa—mapping them against the **MITRE ATT\&CK for ICS** framework to demonstrate potential kinetic risks. Furthermore, it scrutinizes the geopolitical friction points in West Africa and Southeast Asia that threaten supply chain integrity, positioning cyber-physical resilience as a mechanism for business continuity rather than a mere IT cost center.

**2\. Corporate Structure, Financial Health, and Strategic Direction**

Understanding the financial and structural reality of ofi is a prerequisite for any commercial engagement. The organization is operating under a mandate to prove its standalone value distinct from the commodity trading volatility associated with its parent, Olam Group.

#### **2.1 The Reorganization and Value Creation Mandate**

ofi was established in 2020 following a strategic reorganization of Olam International Limited. The parent entity split its portfolio into three distinct operating groups to unlock shareholder value and eliminate the "conglomerate discount" 2:

1. **ofi (Olam Food Ingredients):** Focused on value-added ingredients (Cocoa, Coffee, Dairy, Nuts, Spices).  
2. **Olam Agri:** Focused on food, feed, and fiber commodities.  
3. **Remaining Olam Group:** Holding legacy assets and incubator ventures.

This separation is critical for a GTM strategy because ofi now controls its own capital allocation and strategic roadmap. The recently announced **US$500 million equity investment** into ofi 1 is a definitive signal that the organization has liquidity for capital expenditures (CapEx). This investment is explicitly targeted at "unlocking full potential value," which in the current industrial climate implies digital modernization, capacity expansion, and sustainability initiatives. For a service provider, this capital injection signifies that budget is available for *strategic* infrastructure projects, provided they can be linked to value creation or asset protection (e.g., securing a new high-value processing plant).

#### **2.2 Financial Performance Analysis (2024)**

The 2024 financial results delineate a company that is growing in profitability but facing working capital constraints due to commodity price inflation.

**Table 1: 2024 Financial Performance & Strategic Implications**

| Metric | Performance (S$) | YoY Growth | Strategic Implication for Cyber Services |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Revenue** | 21.8 Billion | \+40.1% | The massive revenue scale indicates a high volume of transactions and data flow. The 40% jump, driven by price and volume, suggests critical reliance on the availability of ERP systems (SAP) and logistics platforms. |
| **EBIT** | 1.07 Billion | \+29.1% | ofi is the profit engine of the group (outperforming Olam Agri's 5.8% growth).3 Executive protection of this margin is paramount. Cyber services must be framed as "margin protection" against downtime. |
| **Working Capital** | Significant Increase | N/A | High commodity prices (Cocoa/Coffee) have tied up cash in inventory.4 This negative free cash flow environment means discretionary OpEx will be tight. Services must be pitched as CapEx (part of facility upgrades) or compliance-mandatory (NIS2). |
| **Gearing** | 2.79x (Group Net) | Increased | High leverage increases sensitivity to financial shocks. A ransomware attack causing business interruption would be financially catastrophic, making cyber insurance eligibility (and thus cyber maturity) a key driver. |

Data Source: 3

The divergence in performance underscores that ofi is the "crown jewel" of the group. The 29.1% EBIT growth was led by the **Ingredients & Solutions** segment 3, validating the strategy of moving downstream into manufacturing. This shift from trading to manufacturing increases the **Operational Technology (OT)** attack surface, as revenue is now generated by *machines* rather than just *contracts*.

#### **2.3 Executive Leadership Profiles**

Account-based marketing requires precise targeting of the C-suite. The leadership at ofi combines long-tenured Olam veterans with newer functional leaders.

* **A. Shekhar (CEO):** An Olam veteran since 1992, Shekhar is the architect of the ofi spin-off.6 His mandate is to prepare the company for an IPO. He will be hyper-sensitive to *reputational risk* and *governance* issues that could derail a listing.  
* **Rishi Kalra (CFO):** Kalra manages the financial architecture. Given the focus on "disciplined capital allocation" 3, he will require a robust Return on Investment (ROI) model for security spending. He is also involved in the "multi-capital accounting" initiative, linking finance to sustainability.6  
* **Stephen Byers (Chief Digital & Information Officer):** Byers is the primary stakeholder for technology. He has publicly championed the partnership with **Mindsprint**.7 A GTM strategy must acknowledge his existing roadmap and position new services as *complementary* technical assurance rather than a replacement of his trusted partners.  
* **Sandeep Jain (Chief Commercial Officer & CEO of Dairy/F\&B Solutions):** Jain oversees the high-growth Dairy segment and global sales.6 He is a key decision-maker for the new manufacturing investments in New Zealand and will be concerned with *speed-to-market* for new facilities.  
* **Susanne Folkerts (Global Head of Sustainability & Operations):** Folkerts bridges the gap between operations and ESG. She is responsible for the biomass boiler projects and the **AtSource** platform.8 She is a critical persona for pitching "integrity of sustainability data" and NIS2 compliance for environmental assets.

**3\. Operational Landscape and Industrial Asset Analysis**

ofi operates a vast industrial footprint comprising over **120 manufacturing facilities** and **19 innovation centers** across 50 countries.9 This physical infrastructure is the primary revenue generator and, consequently, the primary cyber-physical risk vector. Understanding the specific processes at these sites allows for a "Commissioning and Design" GTM proposition that speaks directly to engineering reality.

#### **3.1 The Product Platforms and Industrial Risks**

**Table 2: Product Platform Industrial Footprint & OT Risks**

| Platform | Key Industrial Processes | Major Hubs | Specific Cyber-Physical Risks (OT) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Cocoa** | Alkalization, Roasting, Grinding, Pressing (Liquor/Butter) | **Germany (Mannheim)**, **Netherlands (Koog aan de Zaan)**, Singapore, Ivory Coast, Ghana | **Thermal Runaway:** Manipulation of roasting temperatures could cause fires. **Biomass Boilers:** New energy assets in Mannheim are connected to IT/OT networks.8 |
| **Dairy** | Spray Drying, Pasteurization, Evaporation, Blending | **New Zealand (Tokoroa)**, Malaysia | **Bio-Hazard:** Tampering with pasteurization time/temp creates food safety risks. **Explosion:** Spray dryers are high-risk dust explosion zones; safety instrumented systems (SIS) are critical targets. |
| **Spices** | Cryogenic Milling, Steam Sterilization, Irradiation | **Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh, Dong Nai)**, **USA (Las Cruces, NM)** | **Sterilization Bypass:** Disabling steam sterilization logic allows pathogens (Salmonella) to pass through, causing global recalls. **Cryogenic Failure:** Manipulation of liquid nitrogen systems poses safety risks.10 |
| **Coffee** | Freeze Drying, Spray Drying, Agglomeration | **Vietnam**, Brazil, India | **Process Quality:** Precise control of extraction and drying determines flavor profiles. Cyber disruption here destroys product value (batch spoilage). |
| **Nuts** | Shelling, Optical Sorting, Pasteurization (PPO/Steam) | **USA (Hughson, CA)**, Vietnam, India | **Sorting Disruption:** Ransomware on optical sorters halts high-speed lines. **Allergen Cross-Contamination:** Manipulation of production schedules could lead to undeclared allergens. |

#### **3.2 Key Facility Deep Dive: The "Commissioning" Opportunity**

For a firm specializing in industrial facility design and testing, ofi offers tangible, active projects:

* **New Zealand (Tokoroa Dairy Plant):**  
  * *Status:* Phase 1 opened in late 2023; expansion for high-value ingredients is ongoing.11  
  * *Technology:* Includes a biomass boiler fueled by wood residue.11  
  * *GTM Opportunity:* "Secure Commissioning." Offer to conduct Site Acceptance Testing (SAT) that includes cybersecurity validation for the new spray dryers and boiler controls *before* they are fully integrated. This prevents "baking in" vulnerabilities.  
* **Germany (Mannheim Cocoa Facility):**  
  * *Status:* Operational, recently commissioned a circular biomass boiler in partnership with **MVV Energie**.8  
  * *Technology:* This boiler provides 90% of the steam for the factory.  
  * *GTM Opportunity:* This represents a **Critical Infrastructure** dependency. The integration of a third-party utility (MVV) with ofi's internal process network creates a complex boundary. A specialized security audit of this IT/OT interface is a high-priority service, especially under German NIS2 laws (BSIG).  
* **Vietnam (Spice & Nut Hubs):**  
  * *Status:* ofi is the largest exporter of cashews and pepper in Vietnam, with 7 factories.13 Recent expansions included cryogenic milling capabilities.10  
  * *GTM Opportunity:* These facilities are highly automated. As Vietnam becomes a premier manufacturing hub, ensuring these plants meet Western cybersecurity standards (like NIST or IEC 62443\) is essential for supply chain assurance.

### ---

**4\. Technological Ecosystem and The "Mindsprint" Factor**

A central element of ofi's digital strategy is its symbiotic relationship with **Mindsprint** (formerly Olam Technology and Business Services). Understanding this relationship is crucial to avoid proposing conflicting services.

#### **4.1 The Mindsprint Ecosystem**

Mindsprint functions as ofi's managed service provider and digital innovation engine.

* **Capabilities:** Mindsprint offers "AI-Powered Infra & Cybersecurity," covering cyber defense, identity management, and GRC.7 They claim deep industry expertise and partnerships with major tech vendors.  
* **The Conflict:** Pitching generic "Cyber Threat Monitoring" (SOC) services puts you in direct competition with Mindsprint.  
* **The Wedge:** Mindsprint’s marketing emphasizes *enterprise IT*, *digital platforms*, and *AI acceleration*.7 There is less evidence of deep, heavy-industrial engineering capability (e.g., PLC programming, SCADA architecture design).  
* **Strategy:** Position your services as the **Operational Technology (OT) Specialists** who collaborate with Mindsprint. While Mindsprint secures the SAP cloud and corporate endpoints, your firm secures the *factory floor*, the *biomass boilers*, and the *ICS networks*. This "co-managed" model respects the incumbent while addressing a specialized gap.

#### **4.2 Core Technology Stack**

* **ERP:** **SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition** (RISE with SAP) hosted on **AWS**.14 This is the digital core for all logistics and finance.  
* **Cloud:** **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is the primary infrastructure partner.15  
* **Sustainability Platform:** **AtSource**. A proprietary digital platform tracking sustainability metrics across the supply chain.16 It likely relies on IoT data ingestion from farms and factories.  
* **Connectivity:** ofi uses mobile apps like **ofi Direct** to transact with farmers.17 This expands the perimeter to millions of unmanaged mobile devices.

#### **4.3 Partner Ecosystem**

Through Mindsprint and Olam, ofi is part of an ecosystem that includes:

* **Cybersecurity Vendors:** Fortinet (Network), Dynatrace (Observability).18 In the OT space, Mindsprint likely leverages partners like **Claroty**, **Nozomi Networks**, or **Dragos**, as these are standard for large industrial conglomerates, though specific deployment details at ofi are not public. The GTM approach should assume ofi has *tools* but may lack the *human analysis* for OT alerts.  
* **Integrators:** Mindsprint serves as the primary integrator, but for physical plant construction (like Tokoroa), ofi likely engages local engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firms.

### ---

**5\. Regulatory and Geopolitical Threat Horizon**

The regulatory environment in Europe has shifted from "guidance" to "enforcement" with the NIS2 Directive, creating a hard compliance deadline for ofi.

#### **5.1 The NIS2 Directive: A Compliance Cliff**

The **Network and Information Security (NIS2) Directive** is the single most significant regulatory driver for ofi in Europe.

* **Scope:** ofi falls under the **"Production, processing and distribution of food"** sector. With \>€50m turnover and \>250 employees, it qualifies as an **"Important"** or potentially **"Essential"** entity depending on specific national interpretations in Germany and the Netherlands.19  
* **Germany (BSIG):** The Mannheim facility subjects ofi to the German implementation of NIS2. This law imposes strict requirements for risk management, supply chain security, and incident reporting (24-hour early warning).21  
* **Netherlands (Wbni):** The Koog aan de Zaan facility and ofi's significant Dutch presence mean it must comply with Dutch cybersecurity laws. The Netherlands NCSC is active in enforcing these standards for critical sectors.22  
* **Penalties:** Non-compliance can lead to fines of up to **€10 million or 2% of global turnover**.19 Crucially, **management bodies (Directors) can be held personally liable** for failing to approve and oversee cybersecurity measures.21  
* **GTM Hook:** Offer a "NIS2 Director Assurance Package." This includes an audit of the German/Dutch facilities to provide the Board with the independent validation they need to avoid personal liability.

#### **5.2 Geopolitical Risks & Supply Chain Fragility**

* **West Africa (Cocoa):** Sourcing from Ghana and Ivory Coast exposes ofi to political instability and infrastructure fragility. Internet shutdowns or power grid failures in these regions can blind the central ERP to logistics movements.  
* **Red Sea Logistics:** As a global trader, ofi relies on maritime routes. Disruptions in the Red Sea (Houthi attacks) force longer shipping routes, increasing the window of risk for cargo. Cyberattacks on logistics partners (e.g., DP World) can strand inventory.  
* **Vietnam:** As a primary processing hub, Vietnam is geopolitically stable but faces increasing cybercrime from regional syndicates.23 The intertwining of ofi's supply chain with local Vietnamese logistics providers introduces third-party digital risk.

### ---

**6\. Comprehensive Cyber Threat Assessment (MITRE ATT\&CK)**

To validate the need for "Cyber Threat Monitoring," we must articulate the specific threats ofi faces. Using the **MITRE ATT\&CK for ICS** framework, we can construct realistic attack scenarios that threaten ofi's business objectives.

#### **6.1 Threat Actors**

* **Cybercriminal Groups (Ransomware):** Groups like *BlackBasta* or *LockBit* target manufacturing to force payments by halting production. The food sector is a frequent target (e.g., Dole, Sysco) because spoilage creates time pressure.24  
* **Hacktivists:** Given ofi's involvement in land use and commodities, environmental hacktivists could target them to protest perceived deforestation or water usage, potentially defacing websites or leaking sustainability data.  
* **Insider Threats:** With 2.4 million farmers and thousands of plant employees, the risk of a disgruntled employee or contractor abusing access is high.26

#### **6.2 Detailed Attack Scenarios (MITRE Mapping)**

**Scenario A: The "Sterilization Bypass" (Safety & Reputation)**

* **Objective:** Cause reputational damage or extortion by compromising food safety.  
* **Target:** Steam sterilization units in the Vietnam spice facility.  
* **Techniques:**  
  * *Initial Access (T1133):* Compromise of a remote maintenance vendor credential used for boiler support.  
  * *Lateral Movement (T0866):* Pivot from the IT network to the OT VLAN due to poor segmentation.  
  * *Execution (T0807):* Use Command-Line Interface to modify PLC logic.  
  * *Impact (T0831 \- Manipulation of Control):* Alter the temperature setpoint for sterilization by \-5°C. This is subtle enough to avoid immediate alarms but sufficient to allow pathogens to survive.  
  * *Consequence:* Global recall of spice products, massive lawsuit liability, and brand devastation.

**Scenario B: The "Biomass Boiler Shutdown" (Operational Downtime)**

* **Objective:** Extortion via production halt.  
* **Target:** The biomass boiler in Mannheim, Germany.  
* **Techniques:**  
  * *Initial Access (T1190):* Exploit vulnerability in the web-based HMI of the boiler system.  
  * *Discovery (T0888):* Identify the specific controllers managing steam pressure.  
  * *Impact (T0813 \- Denial of Service):* Flood the controller with traffic or send a "Stop" command.  
  * *Consequence:* The factory loses 90% of its steam power.8 Production stops immediately. Cocoa butter solidifies in pipes, requiring weeks of manual cleaning and repair (Kinetic destruction).

**Scenario C: The "Sustainability Data Poisoning" (Compliance Fraud)**

* **Objective:** Undermine ofi's EUDR compliance or manipulate carbon credit values.  
* **Target:** The **AtSource** platform data pipeline.  
* **Techniques:**  
  * *Initial Access (T1195):* Supply chain compromise of the *ofi Direct* mobile app used by farmers.  
  * *Execution (T1059):* Inject false geolocation data or yield data into the upload stream.  
  * *Impact (T1565 \- Data Manipulation):* The AtSource dashboard reports sustainable sourcing for cocoa that is actually from deforested land.  
  * *Consequence:* ofi is audited by the EU, found non-compliant with EUDR, and faces export bans and fines.

### ---

**7\. Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy**

This GTM strategy is designed for a cybersecurity services firm to penetrate ofi by addressing the specific "Unsatisfied Requirements" identified in the research: OT security specialization, NIS2 compliance validation, and capital project commissioning.

#### **7.1 Target Buyer Personas**

1. **The "Shield" (Stephen Byers, CDIO):** Needs to ensure the *Mindsprint* digital transformation is secure. He values *technical competence* and *integration*.  
   * *Messaging:* "We extend your digital visibility into the physical plant floor, ensuring your SAP S/4HANA core is not compromised by an OT breach."  
2. **The "Builder" (Sandeep Jain / Regional Engineering Leads):** Focused on the Tokoroa and Vietnam expansions. Needs projects delivered *on time*.  
   * *Messaging:* "Secure Commissioning ensures your new $100m facility doesn't fail its first safety audit. We bake security in during the SAT/FAT phase, preventing costly retrofits."  
3. **The "Guardian" (Regional Compliance Officers \- Germany/Netherlands):** Terrified of NIS2 liability.  
   * *Messaging:* "Our NIS2 Director Assurance audit provides the independent evidence you need to prove 'Duty of Care' to regulators and your Board."

#### **7.2 Service Alignment & "Wedge" Offerings**

**Wedge 1: Industrial Facility Design & Commissioning (The CapEx Play)**

* **Context:** ofi is investing $500m. New plants are being built.  
* **Offer:** **"Cyber-Physical Site Acceptance Testing (CP-SAT)."**  
* **Detail:** Propose a service that integrates with their Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) contractors. You do not just check if the boiler works; you check if the boiler's *network* is segmented, if default passwords are removed, and if remote access is secured *before* the site goes live.  
* **Target:** Tokoroa Dairy Expansion, Vietnam Spice Upgrades.

**Wedge 2: NIS2 Compliance Readiness (The Regulatory Play)**

* **Context:** Deadline is passed; enforcement is looming in Germany/Netherlands.  
* **Offer:** **"NIS2 Gap Analysis & Remediation Roadmap for Food Processors."**  
* **Detail:** A specialized audit for the Mannheim and Koog facilities. Focus on "Supply Chain Security" (Article 21 of NIS2), which is notoriously difficult. Offer to audit the security of the *suppliers* feeding these plants, relieving ofi of the burden.  
* **Target:** European Operations Directors, Legal Counsel.

**Wedge 3: Supply Chain Threat Monitoring (The Operational Play)**

* **Context:** ofi relies on AtSource and farmer apps.  
* **Offer:** **"Integrity Monitoring for Digital Agriculture."**  
* **Detail:** A niche monitoring service that focuses on *data integrity* anomalies in the AtSource pipeline. "We don't just watch for hackers; we watch for data manipulation that threatens your sustainability claims."  
* **Target:** Susanne Folkerts (Sustainability Head).

#### **7.3 Competitive Positioning against Mindsprint**

Do not frame your firm as a replacement for Mindsprint. Frame it as a **Specialist Augmentation**.

* **Mindsprint \= IT & Enterprise:** They handle the cloud, the ERP, the helpdesk.  
* **Your Firm \= OT & Industrial:** You handle the PLCs, the SCADA, the safety systems, and the physical plant commissioning.  
* **Value Prop:** "Mindsprint connects your business; We protect the machines that power it."

### **8\. Conclusion**

Olam Food Ingredients is a "Target Rich Environment" for a specialized cybersecurity firm. The organization is capital-rich ($500m investment), asset-heavy (120+ plants), and regulation-bound (NIS2). The convergence of these factors creates a window of opportunity to sell high-value, engineering-led security services. By focusing on the **industrial risks** (biomass boilers, sterilization), **regulatory pressures** (Germany/Netherlands), and **new capital projects** (New Zealand), a service provider can successfully embed itself as a critical partner in ofi's growth story, safeguarding the very assets that generate its 29% profit growth. The strategy is not to sell "cybersecurity" in the abstract, but to sell "Industrial Resilience" and "Regulatory Assurance" in the specific context of their evolving business.
