# **Olam Group Limited: Strategic Restructuring, Operational Architecture, and Subsidiary Analysis (2024–2025)**

## **1\. Strategic Genesis and Corporate Reorganization**

The global agribusiness sector faces a pivotal moment of transformation, driven by the diverging demands of food security, culinary innovation, and sustainability. Within this macro-environment, Olam Group Limited has undertaken one of the most ambitious corporate restructurings in the history of the soft commodities industry. Initiated in 2020 and crystallizing through 2024 and 2025, the reorganization of Olam International into three distinct operating groups—**ofi (Olam Food Ingredients)**, **Olam Agri**, and the **Remaining Olam Group**—represents a calculated dismantling of the conglomerate structure to unlock shareholder value and operational focus.

The underlying strategic logic posits that the group’s two primary engines require fundamentally different capital structures, management philosophies, and investor bases. **ofi** operates as a value-added ingredient provider serving the complex needs of the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) sector, a model that demands high R\&D intensity, customer intimacy, and a premium valuation multiple typical of the ingredients sector. Conversely, **Olam Agri** functions as a high-volume, logistics-driven merchant of staple calories and feed, operating in high-growth emerging markets where arbitrage, trade flows, and food security define success.

By 2025, this reorganization has evolved from a dual-IPO strategy into a hybrid divestment and capitalization model. While **ofi** continues to prepare for a potential primary listing on the London Stock Exchange with a secondary listing in Singapore, **Olam Agri** has pursued a strategic sale path. In February 2025, Olam Group announced a definitive agreement to sell its remaining equity in Olam Agri to the Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company (SALIC), a subsidiary of the Public Investment Fund (PIF).1 This transaction, structured in two tranches, values Olam Agri at US$4.0 billion 1, validating the premise that the sum of Olam’s parts exceeds its conglomerate whole.

This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the operational footprints, subsidiary networks, and product portfolios of these three entities, contextualizing their trajectories within the geopolitical and economic realities of the mid-2020s.

## ---

**2\. ofi (Olam Food Ingredients): The Value-Added Engine**

**ofi** has positioned itself at the nexus of raw material origination and culinary solution provision. Headquartered commercially in London with corporate roots in Singapore, the entity operates under the "plant to palate" philosophy, leveraging its integrated supply chain to offer traceability and sustainability as core product attributes alongside flavor and function. The organization is led by CEO A. Shekhar and CFO Rishi Kalra 2, overseen by a board chaired by Niall FitzGerald.3

### **2.1 The Cocoa Platform: Processing and Innovation**

The cocoa platform represents one of **ofi**'s most capital-intensive and technologically advanced business lines. Competing directly with industry titans like Barry Callebaut and Cargill, **ofi** has established a top-three global position in cocoa processing.

#### **2.1.1 European Processing and Sustainability**

The operational heart of the cocoa business beats in Europe, where heritage brands and advanced manufacturing converge. In the Netherlands, the **Koog aan de Zaan** facility stands as a flagship of the **deZaan** brand, which has produced premium cocoa powders, liquors, and butters for over a century.4 This facility is not merely a processing plant but a testbed for industrial sustainability. In collaboration with the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO), **ofi** has installed a circular biomass boiler at this site that utilizes residual cocoa shells to generate steam, thereby reducing natural gas consumption and cutting carbon emissions.5

A parallel development exists in Germany at the **Mannheim** processing facility. Operated by **Olam Cocoa Deutschland GmbH**, this site has partnered with the energy utility MVV Energie to deploy a similar biomass boiler system.5 This technological standardization across borders highlights **ofi**'s strategy of replicating best-in-class engineering solutions to meet the European Union’s stringent environmental directives, including the Green Deal and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

In Spain, the subsidiary **Olam Food Ingredients Spain S.L.U.** manages critical assets including the **Macao** brand's processing facility in **Valencia**.6 The Macao brand specializes in cocoa powders tailored for the bakery and confectionery sectors, requiring specific alkalization processes to achieve consistent color and flavor profiles. The Valencia site integrates milling capabilities with a state-of-the-art laboratory to ensure attribute stability, a critical requirement for industrial baking customers who demand uniformity.6

#### **2.1.2 North American and African Operations**

The North American cocoa footprint is anchored by the **Bolingbrook, Illinois** facility, which serves as **ofi**'s sole cocoa processing plant in the United States.7 This strategic location near Chicago—a major hub for the US food industry—allows **ofi** to supply cocoa powders rapidly to Midwest food manufacturers.

In West Africa, the source of the raw material, **ofi** operates through subsidiaries such as **Unicao** in Côte d'Ivoire. The processing assets are located in the **Zone Industrielle de Vridi** in Abidjan and in San Pedro.8 These facilities perform the initial grind, transforming raw beans into cocoa liquor and cake, which are then shipped to European or American facilities for final refining. This value-added-at-source model retains economic value within the origin country while reducing the shipping weight of the commodity.

### **2.2 The Coffee Platform: Soluble Solutions and Green Bean Trading**

**ofi** is a top-two global supplier of green coffee, but its strategic pivot is towards soluble (instant) coffee and value-added extracts, which offer higher margins and stability against commodity price volatility.

#### **2.2.1 Manufacturing Subsidiaries**

A key asset in this portfolio is **Seda Outspan Iberia**, located in **Palencia, Spain**.9 Acquired to bolster the private-label offering, Seda specializes in the production of soluble coffee and complex packaging formats for European retailers. The facility is supported by a dedicated logistics center in nearby **Villamuriel**, enabling efficient distribution across the Iberian Peninsula and into Western Europe. The integration of Seda allows **ofi** to offer a "white label" solution to supermarkets, effectively competing with branded instant coffees.

In North America, the acquisition of **Club Coffee** has expanded **ofi**'s capabilities into the roasting and grinding segment. Club Coffee is a Canadian leader in the single-serve market and has innovated in sustainable packaging, developing compostable pods that align with **ofi**’s broader sustainability goals.10

#### **2.2.2 Origination and Estates**

The supply chain supporting these manufacturing assets spans 18 producing countries. Unlike many competitors who rely solely on third-party procurement, **ofi** owns and operates large coffee estates. Notable among these are the estates in **Zambia** and **Brazil**, which focus on high-quality Robusta and specialty Arabica varieties.11 Direct ownership of estates allows **ofi** to control agronomic practices, ensuring pesticide compliance and yield optimization, which feeds directly into their premium "single estate" product lines.

### **2.3 The Spices Platform: Aggressive Expansion and Innovation**

The spices segment has witnessed the most aggressive inorganic growth, transforming **ofi** from a raw material supplier into a leading manufacturer of private-label spices and seasonings.

#### **2.3.1 North American Manufacturing**

The acquisition of **Olde Thompson** in 2021 was a watershed moment, providing **ofi** with a massive manufacturing and distribution footprint in the US.7 Based in **Oxnard, California**, Olde Thompson is a dominant player in the private label spice category, supplying major retailers with packed, shelf-ready products.

This downstream capability is vertically integrated with upstream processing assets:

* **Las Cruces, New Mexico:** A 22-acre manufacturing campus dedicated to the production of paprika and chili powders. This facility sits in the heart of the chili-growing belt, reducing logistics costs for raw material intake.7  
* **Hanford, California:** This facility claims the title of the world’s largest vertically integrated garlic and dried onion processor.7 The scale of Hanford allows **ofi** to dictate terms in the dehydrated vegetable market, processing millions of pounds of garlic annually.  
* **Fresno, California:** Home to the **Ingredient Excellence Center (IEC)** for spices. This facility is not a factory but an innovation hub where food scientists and chefs work to develop new seasoning blends.7

#### **2.3.2 European Distribution**

In Europe, the spices and nut business is bolstered by **Märsch Importhandels-GmbH**, a subsidiary based in **Ulm, Germany**.12 Märsch serves as a critical logistics and packaging node for the European retail trade. The Ulm facility features a fully automated, temperature-controlled high-bay warehouse with 11,000 pallet slots, designed to handle the high-velocity demands of supermarket promotional cycles.12

### **2.4 The Dairy and Nut Platforms**

While less fragmented than spices, the dairy and nut platforms maintain significant industrial assets.

* **Dairy:** Operations bridge the Southern and Northern hemispheres. Key processing plants are located in **Tokoroa, New Zealand**, and **Malaysia**. The business model focuses on functional dairy ingredients like fat-filled milk powders, supported by distribution centers in high-demand markets like Nigeria, China, and Indonesia.13  
* **Nuts:** **Hughson Nut**, based in California, is a cornerstone of the almond business. With manufacturing sites in **Leedom, Verduga, and Livingston**, Hughson is a top processor in the state.7 In Vietnam, **ofi** operates large-scale cashew processing facilities. These plants have undergone significant mechanization to reduce reliance on manual labor, addressing ethical concerns often associated with the cashew industry while improving shelling efficiency.

### **2.5 Innovation Architecture**

The "Ingredients & Solutions" segment is powered by a network of **Customer Solution Centers (CSCs)**. These are not mere sales offices but technical laboratories where clients can co-create products.

* **Locations:** Chicago, Amsterdam, Bangalore, and Singapore.14  
* **Function:** The Amsterdam CSC, for instance, serves the European market, allowing customers to prototype new chocolate or coffee beverages using **ofi** ingredients.  
* **Digital Tools:** Innovation extends to software with the **Carbon Scenario Planner (CSP)**. This tool allows customers to model the environmental impact of different ingredient choices, effectively monetizing **ofi**’s sustainability data.11

**3\. Olam Agri: The Food Security and Logistics Powerhouse**

If **ofi** is the chef, **Olam Agri** is the grocer to the world. Focused on high-growth emerging markets, Olam Agri deals in the fundamental calories—grains, edible oils, rice—and industrial fibers that sustain populations and economies. The entity is led by Sunny Verghese (who retains his role as Group CEO) and N. Muthukumar 16, with a clear mandate to dominate trade flows in Asia and Africa.

### **3.1 Grains, Oilseeds, and Feed**

This segment is the volume heavy-weight of the group, managing millions of metric tonnes of wheat, maize, soy, and barley.

#### **3.1.1 European Trading Hub**

The nerve center for international grain trading is located in **Rotterdam, Netherlands**. The Rotterdam trading desk manages the flow of grains and vegetable oils into Europe and the Black Sea region.17 This office coordinates with the Freight Management team to optimize the arbitrage between origin pricing and destination demand.

#### **3.1.2 African Processing Leadership**

In Nigeria, Olam Agri is a systemic player in national food security. Through its subsidiary Crown Flour Mills, it operates massive wheat milling infrastructure, converting imported wheat into flour for the domestic bakery and pasta markets. The scale of these operations makes Olam Agri one of the largest non-oil foreign investors in Nigeria.  
Expansion continues in West Africa, evidenced by the March 2024 acquisition of Avisen SARL in Senegal for US$22 million.18 This acquisition moves Olam Agri further downstream into the animal feed and protein sector, capturing value from the rising meat consumption in the region.

#### **3.1.3 Edible Oils consolidation**

In a strategic transfer of assets, Olam Agri acquired the **Fasorel** edible oil refinery in Mozambique from the Remaining Olam Group in 2024 for US$18.7 million.18 This consolidation aligns all agri-processing assets under the Agri umbrella, streamlining the operational structure ahead of the SALIC divestment.

### **3.2 The Fibre Platform: Cotton**

Olam Agri is a tier-one global cotton merchant, operating under the heritage brand **Queensland Cotton** in Australia and other local entities globally.

#### **3.2.1 Queensland Cotton (Australia)**

Acquired by Olam, **Queensland Cotton** is an institution in Australian agriculture, dating back to 1921\.

* **Operational HQ:** Brisbane, Queensland.19  
* **Ginning Infrastructure:** The subsidiary operates seven cotton gins strategically located across the growing valleys of Queensland and New South Wales. Key locations include **Dalby**, **Cecil Plains**, and **Wee Waa**.20  
* **Logistics:** Beyond ginning (separating fiber from seed), the business manages extensive warehousing at Dalby and Cecil Plains. These facilities serve as accumulation points for export, channeling baled cotton to the Port of Brisbane.21  
* **Market Share:** Queensland Cotton procures and processes approximately 20% of the entire Australian national cotton crop, making it a critical partner for Australian farmers.21

#### **3.2.2 Global Cotton Operations**

In the Americas, Olam Agri operates gins and warehouses in the US Cotton Belt and in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil.22 In West Africa (Côte d'Ivoire, Togo, Chad), the model is more integrated, involving direct support to smallholder farmers to secure seed cotton for local ginning, thereby controlling quality from the farm gate.

### **3.3 Wood Products and Bioenergy**

The wood products business, primarily based in the **Republic of Congo**, demonstrates the integration of industrial processing with circular economy principles.

* **Pokola Operations:** Olam Agri manages forestry concessions and sawmills in Pokola.  
* **Co-Generation:** A biomass power plant at the Pokola site utilizes wood waste and sawdust to generate 4 megawatts of electricity. This not only powers the sawmill but also supplies electricity to the surrounding town, functioning as a local utility and enhancing community relations.23

### **3.4 Freight Management**

Supporting these commodity flows is a sophisticated **Freight Management** division. Based in Singapore and the Netherlands, this unit operates as an internal shipping line. It manages a fleet of bulk carriers (Panamax, Supramax) through a mix of ownership and long-term charters.24 Crucially, the desk actively trades **Forward Freight Agreements (FFAs)**, using financial derivatives to hedge the volatility of shipping rates, effectively turning logistics into a profit center rather than just a cost center.

## ---

**4\. Remaining Olam Group: The Incubator and Legacy Portfolio**

The **Remaining Olam Group** serves as the holding vessel for assets that are either gestating (early-stage), non-core (earmarked for divestment), or strategically distinct from the two main operating groups.

### **4.1 Olam Global Holdco (OGH) Assets**

OGH retains the heavy asset base of plantations and legacy investments.

* **Rusmolco (Russia):** A large-scale dairy farming operation in the Penza region. Despite the geopolitical complexities surrounding Russia, Rusmolco continues to operate, primarily supplying the domestic Russian milk market. It serves as a key supplier of raw milk to international processors remaining in the region.1  
* **Gabon Operations:** OGH holds the joint ventures with the Republic of Gabon.  
  * **Olam Palm Gabon:** Develops and manages sustainable palm oil plantations.  
  * **Olam Rubber Gabon:** Manages a 37,000-hectare rubber concession in Bitam and other regions.25  
  * **Gabon Fertilizer Project:** A long-gestating industrial project utilizing local natural gas.  
* **Divestments:** The group is actively liquidating infrastructure assets. In April 2025, Olam announced the sale of its remaining 32.4% stake in **ARISE Ports & Logistics (ARISE P\&L)** for US$175 million.26 This follows previous exits from ARISE IIP (Industrial Zones) and ARISE IS (Infrastructure Services), signaling a full withdrawal from the heavy infrastructure sector to focus on core agri-business.

### **4.2 Mindsprint: The Digital Services Spin-Off**

Formerly known as Olam Technology and Business Services (OTBS), **Mindsprint** has been rebranded and restructured as a standalone technology services company. It serves Olam Group entities but also aggressively targets external customers.

* **Global Footprint:** Headquartered in Singapore, Mindsprint operates major delivery hubs in **Chennai and Bengaluru (India)**. It also maintains commercial offices in **New Jersey (USA)** and **London (UK)**.27  
* \*\* Capabilities:\*\* Mindsprint creates intellectual property from Olam’s digital transformation.  
  * **GuardianEye:** An AI-powered cybersecurity platform that offers external attack surface management and threat detection.28  
  * **Partnerships:** The entity has forged strategic alliances with **ServiceNow** (developing the "SprintNow" workflow solution) and **SAP** (winning innovation awards in Southeast Asia).29  
  * **Cybersecurity:** It acts as the Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) for the group, leveraging partnerships with OT security leaders implied to be **Claroty** or **Nozomi** (standard for Rockwell environments) to protect the industrial networks of **ofi** and Agri.30

### **4.3 Nupo Ventures: Engine 2 Growth**

Nupo Ventures acts as the corporate venture capital and incubation arm.

* **Jiva:** An extensive agri-tech platform providing financing, agronomy advice, and market access to smallholder farmers.  
* **Terrascope:** A SaaS platform for corporate carbon accounting, originally built to manage Olam’s complex Scope 3 emissions and now commercialized for third-party clients.1

## ---

**5\. Financial Architecture and Valuation Analysis (2024-2025)**

The divergence in financial performance between the operating groups in the 2024 fiscal year validates the strategic rationale for the separation.

### **5.1 Performance Divergence**

* **ofi:** Reported **EBIT growth of 29.1%** in 2024, reaching S$1.07 billion.32 This robust performance was driven by the "Ingredients & Solutions" segment, which successfully passed on higher cocoa and coffee prices to customers. The ability to expand margins during a period of historic commodity inflation highlights the pricing power inherent in the value-added model.  
* **Olam Agri:** Delivered **EBIT growth of 5.8%**, reaching S$1.02 billion.32 Growth was volume-driven, particularly in the Fibre and Grains segments. The resilience of Agri’s earnings despite difficult trading conditions underscores the defensive nature of food staples.  
* **Remaining Olam Group:** Reported an **EBIT loss of S$158.7 million**, significantly widening from previous years.18 These losses were primarily non-cash foreign exchange revaluation losses related to Euro-denominated shareholder loans for the Gabon operations.

### **5.2 Debt and Capital Structure**

Despite operational growth, the Group’s net profit (PATMI) declined by 69.0% to S$86.4 million in 2024.\[33\] This disconnect was caused by a surge in net finance costs (up by S$445.7 million) and higher working capital requirements due to inflated cocoa and coffee prices. The **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)** plummeted to negative S$5.9 billion.34

This debt burden elucidates the necessity of the **SALIC transaction**. The total gross proceeds of **US$3.87 billion** from the full divestment of Olam Agri are existentially critical. They will be deployed to de-lever the Remaining Olam Group, aiming to create a debt-free holding company that can patiently monetize the gestational assets without the pressure of interest payments.26

## ---

**6\. Manufacturing Technology and Cybersecurity Framework**

As Olam’s entities digitize their physical assets, the convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) has become a central theme of their risk management and operational strategy.

### **6.1 Manufacturing Technology Partners**

The factories of **ofi** and Olam Agri are increasingly automated, relying on "Industry 4.0" partnerships.

* **Rockwell Automation:** A primary partner for control systems (PLCs, SCADA). In dairy and multi-ingredient processing plants, Rockwell’s distributed control networks replace isolated "islands of automation," allowing for centralized recipe management and batch tracking.36  
* **Siemens:** Deeply integrated into the cocoa processing lines. In Indonesia’s **Cocoa Teaching and Learning Industry (CTLI)**, Siemens technology—including Simatic sensors and AI-enabled **Process Monitoring Analytics (PMA)**—is used to optimize roasting profiles. The system learns to produce the "Golden Batch," maximizing flavor while minimizing energy use.38  
* **ABB:** Provides robotics and smart sensor technology. Olam has deployed ABB’s smart sensors on low-voltage motors across 70 factories globally (including the Singapore cocoa plant and Malaysian dairy plant). These sensors monitor vibration and temperature to predict motor failure before it causes downtime.39

### **6.2 Cybersecurity and Regulatory Compliance**

The digital connectivity of these plants introduces significant cyber risk.

* **NIS2 Directive:** **ofi**’s European subsidiaries, such as **Olam Cocoa B.V.** and **Olam Cocoa Deutschland GmbH**, fall under the "Important Entities" classification of the EU's NIS2 Directive.40 This regulation mandates strict supply chain security auditing, incident reporting timelines, and personal liability for management regarding cyber risk.  
* **Defense in Depth:** **Mindsprint** executes the defense strategy using its **GuardianEye** platform. The security stack likely incorporates OT-specific protection tools from partners like **Claroty** or **Nozomi Networks**, which provide asset visibility and threat detection for industrial control systems (ICS), ensuring that a breach in the IT network cannot easily jump to the manufacturing floor.30

## ---

**7\. Conclusion and Future Outlook**

The trajectory of Olam Group through 2025 is one of specialized disintegration. By cleaving the business into three, Olam effectively addresses the "conglomerate discount" that has long plagued its valuation.

**Olam Agri** is set to exit the public sphere, becoming a private, sovereign-backed food security titan. Its future lies in securing caloric flows from the Americas and Black Sea to the Middle East and Asia, backed by Saudi capital.

**ofi** remains the public face of the group (via Olam Group Limited), transforming into a pure-play ingredients company. Its success will depend on its ability to leverage its European and American manufacturing footprint to deliver high-margin solutions, justifying a re-rating closer to peers like Kerry Group or Barry Callebaut.

**Mindsprint** has successfully pivoted from a cost center to a profit center, proving that the digital IP developed to manage a complex supply chain has commercial value in the open market.

However, the **Remaining Olam Group** remains a challenge. The heavy gestational assets in Gabon and Russia require patience and capital. The success of the entire restructuring creates a dependency on the seamless closing of the SALIC deal to clear the debt overhang. If executed as planned, the Olam of 2026 will bear little resemblance to the trading house of 2020, having evolved into a network of specialized, focused, and capitalizing entities.
