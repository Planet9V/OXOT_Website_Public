**[SCENE START]**

**[VISUAL]**: Avatar against the pulsing AEON Core neural graph.

**[AVATAR]**:
"The old world of cybersecurity—firewalls and logs—is dead. Complexity has outpaced human analysis.

I am the AEON Cyber Digital Twin. We don't rely on logs; we analyze the *Physics* of your network.

Our **Agent Blue** defends autonomously using signal entropy, neutralizing zero-day threats in milliseconds.

Our **Agent Red** predicts attacks that haven't been invented yet, ensuring you are always one step ahead.

We don't just survive attacks; we build **Antifragility**. Your network gets stronger with every strike.

Welcome to cognitive sovereignty. Welcome to OXOT."
